        <h2>A salubrious ramen that will spice up your weekly menu.</h2>
        <p>If you are tired of throwing the same top ramen in the microwave, you should try out this recipe. Both short and simple, it won't take too much work!</p>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Select the Sauté function on a multi-functional electric pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®). Heat sesame oil in the pot. Add pork to the pot and sauté until browned on the edges, about 5 minutes. Push Cancel to end Sauté function. Remove pork with a slotted spoon, leaving sesame oil in the pot, and set aside.</li>
              <li>Add water, soy sauce, and 4 seasoning packs from ramen packages to the pot and stir with a wooden or plastic spoon, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits.</li>
              <li>Break noodles from ramen packages in half and add to the pot. Make sure noodles are as evenly submerged in the liquid as you can, but do not stir. Return pork to the pot, placing them on top of the noodles, without stirring.</li>
              <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer’s instructions; set timer for 1 minute. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
              <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer’s instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
              <li>Add broccoli and bell pepper to the pot and stir until any noodles that were stuck together have broken up. Place the lid back over the pot, askew, and let sit until vegetables are crisp-tender and most of the liquid has absorbed into the noodles, 3 to 5 minutes. Ladle into individual bowls; sprinkle with green onions to serve.
              </li>
          </ol>
